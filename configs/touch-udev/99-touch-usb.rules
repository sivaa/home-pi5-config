# Disable USB autosuspend for ILITEK Touch Screen
# Prevents the kernel from putting the touch controller to sleep, which causes
# intermittent touch response (missed first taps, need to press twice).
#
# Vendor ID:  222a (ILI Technology Corp.)
# Product ID: 0001 (Multi-Touch Screen)
#
# NOTE: This rule matches by Vendor/Product ID, NOT by USB port!
#       Device can be moved to any USB port and rule still applies.

# Deploy: sudo cp 99-touch-usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
# Reload: sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
